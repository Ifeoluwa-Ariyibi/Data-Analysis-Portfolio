## About 
Hi, I'm Ifeoluwa!

I have an analytical background in Accounting and recently completed my degree in International Business with Data Analytics. As an enthusiastic finance professional, I bring a solid foundation in accounting and data analysis, complemented by strong customer service experience. My passion lies in using data to uncover meaningful insights, and I am excited to apply my technical and analytical skills to the field of Data Analytics.

Throughout my studies, I developed a keen ability to work with complex data, identify patterns, and analyze trends. My experience in data management and statistical analysis will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

Currently, I am working as an intern with BlueSteel Solution as a Power BI Developer/Data Analyst. I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and continuously seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.
